const INITIAL_TEXT = [{content: `June 12 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq rallied on Monday to 
their highest closing levels since April 2022, while Oracle hit a record high 
ahead of quarterly results as investors awaited inflation data and the Federal
 Reserve's interest rate decision this week. Lifted by gains in market 
 heavyweights Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O) and Tesla (TSLA.O), the S&P 
 500 has now recovered 21% from its October 2022 lows. Some investors say Wall 
 Street is the midst of a bull market. "The further out the October lows get 
 in the rear view mirror, the more confident investors become. Have investors 
 become more complacent? They probably have, and that's actually a good sign," 
 said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in 
 Tulsa, Oklahoma., Tesla rose 2.2% and has now climbed for 12 straight trading
  sessions, a record for the electric car maker. Apple and Microsoft each rose 
  about 1.5%, with year-to-date gains in the two technology companies' shares 
  reaching 41% and 38%, respectively. The S&P 500 climbed 0.93% to end the

  (.SPLRCD). The U.S. Labor Department's consumer price index reading on 
  Tuesday is expected to show inflation cooled slightly in May, with core 
  prices likely remaining sticky. Tuesday is also first day of the Fed's 
  two-day meeting. Traders see a 76% chance of the central bank holding 
  rates at the 5%-5.25% range on Wednesday, while pricing in a 71% chance

{content: `June 13 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and Nasdaq reached their highest closes in 14 months on Tuesday after data showed consumer prices rose modestly in May, boosting bets that the Federal Reserve will not raise interest rates on Wednesday. Nvidia jumped 3.9%, becoming the first chipmaker to end a trading session with a market capitalization above $1 trillion after smaller rival Advanced Micro Devices gave an update on its artificial intelligence strategy that failed to impress investors. AMD dropped 3.6%. Stocks advanced after a U.S. Labor Department report showed the consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.1% 
last month following a 0.4% jump in April, with core inflation unchanged at 0.4%. On a year-on-year basis, headline inflation increased by a less-than-estimated 4.0%, reflecting declines in the cost of energy products and services, including gasoline and electricity. "If the Fed was looking for data to point to say, 'We're going to pause in June,' I think they got it today," said Liz Young, head of investment strategy at SoFi in New York. "But it's another one of those that you can cut whichever way you want to make your case. If you want to be bullish, you say inflation is down more than 50% since its peak. 
If you want to be bearish, you can say inflation is still more than twice the Fed's target," Young said. Traders have priced in a 93% chance that the U.S. central bank will hold interest rates at the 5%-5.25% range on Wednesday, and 62% odds of 25-basis-point hike in July, according to the CME Fedwatch tool. The benchmark S&P 500 has recovered about 22% from its October 2022 closing low, fueled in large part by gains in market heavyweights such as Apple Inc, Nvidia Corp and Tesla Inc. More recently, sectors such as energy and materials have climbed, as well as small-cap stocks. U.S.-listed shares of Chinese 
companies rose after China's central bank lowered its short-term lending rate for the first time in 10 months. Alibaba Group gained 1.9% and JD.com jumped 3.5%. The S&P 500 climbed 0.69% to end the session at 4,369.01 points. The Nasdaq gained 0.83% to 13,573.32 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.43% to 34,212.12 points.

{content: `June 14 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks ended mixed on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve kept U.S. interest rates unchanged but signaled in new economic projections that borrowing costs will likely rise by another half of a percentage point by the end of this year.

Trading was choppy and volume was heavy after the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reacted to a stronger-than-expected economy and a slower decline in inflation.

The new projections added a hawkish tilt to the Fed's interest rate decision, showing policymakers at the median see the benchmark overnight interest rate rising from the current 5.00%-5.25% range to a 5.50%-5.75% range by the end of the year.

"Some people were expecting that the Fed would actually pause this month, but also not raise rates anymore," said Sam Stovall, Chief Investment Strategist at CFRA Research. "However, it does seem as if the FOMC members have become even more hawkish since the last meeting, and I think that has taken investors by surprise."

Earlier on Wednesday, a bigger-than-expected drop in U.S. producer prices in May due to a decline in the costs of energy goods and food signaled that inflation was cooling. Data a day earlier showed consumer prices moderated last month.

Traders now see a 63% chance the central bank will raise interest rates in July, up from 60% earlier on Wednesday, according to the CME Fedwatch tool.

Shares of Tesla Inc dipped 0.74%, putting the brakes on the electric car maker's 13-session streak of gains, its longest ever. Over $43 billion worth of Tesla shares were traded, more than any other stock in the S&P 500.

Heavyweight chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA.O) and Broadcom (AVGO.O) both rallied more than 4% and closed at their highest levels ever, lifting the Nasdaq and S&P 500. The Philadelphia semiconductor index (.SOX) jumped 1.5%, bringing its gain in 2023 to 48%.

Volume on U.S. exchanges was strong, with 12.1 billion shares traded, compared to an average of 10.7 billion shares over the previous 20 sessions.

The S&P 500 climbed 0.08% to end the session at 4,372.59 points.
